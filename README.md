Hi, this is my first pet project in react.
Here I used such technologies as 
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- React Router Dom
- Typescript
- Firebase authentication
- Firebase storage
- Firebase database
- Styled components


Its name Cha-Pad - some kind of blog for tea lovers.
Here you can create your own profile or sign in with Google, add tea, that you have tasted.
Choose its grade, year of production, write its name, add your review and set rating and upload photo.If size of photo is more than 0,5 MB, it will be compressed.
Your tasting will be added to your profile and to common users posts, so you can check tea tasting added by other users.
